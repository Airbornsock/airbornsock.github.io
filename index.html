	<p>Hi, my name is Jay and I am a postgraduate student at The University Of Leeds, UK. I am currently studying an MSc in GIS (Geographical Information Systems).
	I completed my undergraduate degree in Environmental Science from UWE (Bristol) and I hope to advance my GIS techniques in order to produce high quality digital evelation models using GIS software. </p>

	<h3> <span style="text-decoration: underline;" > My Project  &#128193 </span ;</h3>

	<p> As part of a modular assessment at university, we have been asked to produce a code which involves creating and moving some agents around a given environment, as well as a website which hosts our code, and a link to our GitHub profile. 
	More information on the code and assessment can be found in the "My Project" tab at the top of the webpage, whereas a link to my GitHub profile can be found below.
