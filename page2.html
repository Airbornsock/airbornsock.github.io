		<h2>The assessment </h2>
			<p>Firstly, in order to view my code, make sure your computer is able to read python scripts. I have used "Anaconda" a free open source platform which enables python and R distribtuion. It includes over 100 Python libraries, and "Spyder", the core software for cross platform scienctific programming and manipulation. 
			</p>
			<p> This can be downloaded free at: <p><a title="Anaconda download" href="https://www.anaconda.com/download/">https://www.anaconda.com/download/</a></p></p>
			

			
		
		<p>The code in which I have created, in its simplest description, creates 10 agents (which we are going to call sheep), and randomly places them within our environment, (provided by the univeristy as a simple text file) which we read in using "csv.reader".	The sheep are randomly placed into the environment, and randomly move around the area consuming grass (data).
		</p>
		
			<h3> The Environment</h3>

		<p>This process can be put into animation using "matplotlib.animation". The sheep will stop grazing when a value of "0.01" has been found, this can easily be changed, see line 77 in the "Animation11.py" file.
